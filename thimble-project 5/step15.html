      <article><h2>Learn how to code! For the next 6 exercises, you will make your very own web page. You can publish your website to the web, if you want, but it's not required. You can use Mozilla Thimble, a website where you can write code for free. You can either make an account or not, but the benefit of making an account is that you can save your work. If you don't want to make an account but still keep all your work, then you can download the  code files onto your computer. You can use many tutorials online in deciding and making what you want. You can use websites like codecademy.com to help you get started.
