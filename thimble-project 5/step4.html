      <article><h2>Now create 2 other boxes or use any 2 boxes available.  Find at least 21 different quotes that inspire you to be your very best. Write them all on separate slips of paper. Put them all in either box and take one out. Read this to yourself. Then put it in the box without slips of paper. Think about it once in a while and let it soak into your mind. Think about how the quote you have chosen makes you feel inspired to do more in life. Or you can just carry it around with you and look at it once in a while to make yourself feel inspired to be your very best. You should inspire yourself with one quote each day.
