      <article><h2>For this step, recall back to the problems you discovered at Step 5. Figure out one way to apply creativity into solving problems. For example, if your neighbor is unfortunately in the hospital due to a serious injury and canâ€™t fully pay the bill, then why not create a entertaining fundraiser to help raise money to pay the bill? Do you remember creating a game in Step 10? Use your creativity skills to create games for the fundraiser! Step 10 was for practice so you can make entertaining games. If you notice that a non-profit needs help in creating a website to help spread the word about them and their mission, then help create a website for them! You will be spending 5 days in creating solutions for the problems you have discovered.
